# Evaluation of BPRF 

Basic operations of BPRF have been tested and evaluated using the Java Pairing Based Cryptography Library (JPBC, http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/index.html#.XXePsygzaUk)

This repository includes source code of basic operations of BPRF. Anyone can obtain the implemention result (i.e., the execution time for basic operations) by running this code on their machine.
